# Sharing-notes-website

## The main idea

The purpose of the project was to try out web development and learn a few skills along the way. This website is a kind of platform where students
from my university, more precisely from FENS faculty, would be able to share and to find notes they keep from the lectures and similar occassions.
The website is simple, there are options to share or look for notes, both in the same categories which are divided by years and then subjects in the respective years
(according to syllabus).

### Still in the making...
